ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, color = as.factor(am))) +
  geom_point(show.legend = F)+

```

#how to store previous calculated results: cached

\\```{r raw_data}
    rawdata <- readr::read_csv("a_very_large_file.csv")
```

###```{r processed_data, cached = TRUE}
    processed_data <- rawdata %>%
      filter(!is.na(import_var)) %>%
      mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))
```
