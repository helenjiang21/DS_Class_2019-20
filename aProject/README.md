This is the final project for PRISMS DS class spring semester.

Using the data of 300,000 users and the animes they've watched 
from MyAnimeList (https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist), 
I created an anime recommendation system (made by User-Based Collaborative Filtering), 
which takes three genres and three corresponded animes the user selected to generate a list of ten recommended animes.

The model training and selecting process is shown in the aporj_ty.rmd, 
while some more general visual exploration is included in aproj.rmd. 
By running the shiny app (app.R) you can try out the recommendation system.

Notice: the dataset animelists_cleaned.csv is too big to be uploaded (7GB), thus is not included here.

Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Samsonau and other DS class students (Andy and Yang) for helping me out 
throughout the semester and this project.
