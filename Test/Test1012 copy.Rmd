# Employee Retention Exploration
Here we're trying to find which factors determine the retention time of employees. Why? Because of all the efforts and money a company need to put in for finding a new employee. If we can find such determining factors, companies could formulate measures (such as raising the salary) in response.

## General info. about the dataset
First let's import the data
```{r}
Employee <- read_csv("GitHub/DS_CLASS_2019-20_Helen/Test/employee.csv")
```
It has variables: `r names(Employee)`
```{r}
names(Employee)
```
Change ids from continuous variables to factors
```{r}
employee1 <- mutate(Employee, Employee_id = as.factor(employee_id), Company_id = as.factor(company_id)) %>%
  select(dept:Company_id)
```

##Number of employees

Total number of employees in each company
```{r}
company <- group_by(employee1, Company_id) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()
arrange(company, desc(n))
```

###The number of employees in each department in each company
```{r}
category <- group_by(employee1, Company_id, dept) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()
arrange(category, desc(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(category) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = Company_id, y = n, fill = dept), position = "fill")
```

Some we can see that there are most people doing customer service in all companies, a lot but fewer people working in enigineering, and fewest people working on designing. Knowing this can help us to focus and weight on the requirement of department with most people.

##Factors that determine retention time

###General info about retention time

Since the quit dates of some employees are NA, we can either ignore those data when analyzing the length of the retention time or set them to some abitrary date when analyzing the factors that determine the length of retention. Here I choose to ignore those who didn't quit when considering the factors contribute to those quitting the job. I calculate the percentage of people didn't quit and try to explore its determining factors.

###Percentage of remaining employees

```{r}
retention_company <- 
  filter(employee1, is.na(quit_date)== T) %>% 
  group_by(Company_id) %>%
  count()
retention_company
```
The above code only gives us the number, but we want to find the percentage.
```{r}
company_percentage <- merge(company, retention_company, by = "Company_id", all = T) %>%
  mutate(company_percentage = n.y / n.x) %>%
  arrange(company_percentage)
company_percentage
```
We can see that company 11 has the lowest retention rate, only around 25%, while others are abour 40-50%. Nevertheless, company 11 and 12 only have 20 and 36 employee records in total. If we ignore the, company 7 has the lowest while 2 has the highest. The range of their retention is 43% to 48%.

We can do the same thing for department:
```{r}
department <- group_by(employee1, dept) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()
retention_department <- 
  filter(employee1, is.na(quit_date)== T) %>% 
  group_by(dept) %>%
  count()
dept_percentage <- merge(department, retention_department, by = "dept", all = T) %>%
  mutate(dept_percentage = n.y / n.x) %>%
  arrange(dept_percentage)
dept_percentage
```
Sales has the lowest retention rate, while enigeer has the highest. The range is 43% to 49%.

####Traits of those companies/departments with highest/lowest retention percentage

#####Company Mean Salary 
From my intuition, salary could be a important factor.
```{r}
company_salary <- group_by(employee1, Company_id) %>%
  select(salary) 
ggplot(company_salary) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(Company_id, salary, FUN =mean), y = salary))
```
Compare this order with the order of company retention rate (from the lowest to the highest):
```{r}
company_mean_salary <- group_by(company_salary, Company_id) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(salary))
company_mean_salary1 <- arrange(company_mean_salary, mean)
company_mean_salary1
retention_prep_salary <- data.frame(mean_salary = company_mean_salary1$Company_id, retention = company_percentage$Company_id)
retention_prep_salary
```

Company 12 have significantly lower average salary than the others, but it has the highest retention percentage. Overall, company mean salary cannot explain the retention. 

#####Department mean salary
Repeat about the same process from above.
```{r}
department_salary <- group_by(employee1, dept) %>%
  select(salary) 
ggplot(department_salary) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(dept, salary, FUN =mean), y = salary))
```

```{r}
dept_mean_salary <- group_by(department_salary, dept) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(salary))
dept_mean_salary1 <- arrange(dept_mean_salary, mean)
dept_mean_salary1
retention_prep_dsalary <- data.frame(mean_salary = dept_mean_salary1$dept, retention = dept_percentage$dept)
retention_prep_dsalary
```
The correlation between them is also not so obvious. Though people work in data science and engineer received high salary and most people stay.

####Seniority
```{r}
senior <- group_by(employee1, seniority) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()
retention_seniority <- 
  filter(employee1, is.na(quit_date)== T) %>% 
  group_by(seniority) %>%
  count()
senior_percentage <- merge(senior, retention_seniority, by = "seniority", all = T) %>%
  mutate(senior_percentage = n.y / n.x) %>%
  arrange(senior_percentage)
senior_percentage
```
There are one person who is 98 and one who is 99...Let's make a graph to see the trend.
```{r}
ggplot(senior_percentage) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(x = seniority, y = senior_percentage))
```
I guess there is no obvious relationship.

###Factors that determine the length of retention time
I calculate the retention time from the join and quit dates (only of those who quit the job). The retention is time intercal with unit of days.
```{r}
joindate <- as.Date(as.character(employee1$join_date), "%m/%d/%y")
quitdate <- as.Date(as.character(employee1$quit_date), "%m/%d/%y")
employee2 <- mutate(employee1, retention = as.numeric(difftime(quitdate, joindate), unit = "days")) %>%
  filter(is.na(retention) == F) %>%
  arrange(retention)
employee2
```

To get a quick idea of the retention time in general:
```{r}
summary(select(employee2, retention))
```

```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = retention), binwidth = 20)
```
For some reasons there are three humps. 
Let's see if they are caused by specific factors.

####Company
Because the first bump is much higher than the other two, so I break the graph into to two parts. 
```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = retention, fill = Company_id), postion = "fill") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500))
```

```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = retention, fill = Company_id), postion = "fill") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(500, 1700), ylim = c(0, 100))
```

####Department
```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = retention, fill = dept), postion = "fill") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500))
```

```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = retention, fill = dept), postion = "fill") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(500, 1700), ylim = c(0, 100))
```

####Seniority
```{r}
ggplot(employee2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = seniority, y = retention)) 
```
let's trim the two outliers
```{r}
employee3 <- filter(employee2, seniority < 50)
```

```{r}
ggplot(employee3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = seniority, y = retention), alpha = 1/30) 
```
