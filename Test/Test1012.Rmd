# Employee Retention Exploration
Here we're trying to find which factors determine the retention time of employees. Why? Because of all the efforts and money a company need to put in for finding a new employee. If we can find such determining factors, companies could formulate measures (such as raising the salary) in response.

## General info. about the dataset
First let's import the data
```{r}
Employee <- read_csv("GitHub/DS_CLASS_2019-20_Helen/Test/employee.csv")
```
It has variables: `r names(Employee)`
```{r}
names(Employee)
```
